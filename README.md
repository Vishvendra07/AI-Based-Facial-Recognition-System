# AI-Based Facial Recognition System

This project is an AI-powered facial recognition system designed to detect and identify individuals in real-time using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Identifies and tracks faces in live video streams.
- **Image Augmentation**: Enhances training data with image transformations.
- **Multi-Class Recognition**: Recognizes and labels multiple individuals.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily extendable for additional classes or functionalities.

## File Structure

```
.
├── FaceDetection.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook with the implementation
├── README.md            # Documentation (this file)
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Images are preprocessed and augmented to create robust training datasets.
   - Data is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.
   - Training is optimized using techniques like image augmentation and learning rate scheduling.

3. **Real-Time Detection**:
   - A webcam feed is analyzed frame by frame to detect faces.
   - Identified faces are annotated with bounding boxes and labels.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishvendra07/AI-Based-Facial-Recognition-System.git
   cd AI-Based-Facial-Recognition-System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the `FaceDetection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.

## Usage

- **Training**:
  Use the notebook to train the model with your dataset.
- **Real-Time Detection**:
  Run the detection script to analyze live video streams and detect faces.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve detection accuracy under challenging conditions (e.g., low light, occlusions).
- Add support for additional facial attributes like emotion recognition.
- Deploy the system on mobile devices for portability.
